1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/itsmohitnarayan/Http-Server-Rust.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd actix-web-hello-world
   ```

3. Build and run the project:

4. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see "hello world!".

## Code Explanation ℹ️

This example consists of two main parts:

- `index()` function: This asynchronous function defines the behavior of the '/' route. It simply returns "hello world!" as the response.
  
- `main()` function: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up an Actix-web server with a single route '/' that points to the `index()` function. The server listens on port 3000.

## Dependencies 📦
```
actix-web = "4.5.1"
